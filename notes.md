# Per each position, which scoring category makes up the most points?
## Goalkeeper
| Category      | Avg Pct |
| ------------- | ------- |
| Appearance    | 56.7    |
| Assist        | 0       |
| Clean Sheet   | 30.1    |
| Save          | 28.4    |
| Penalty Save  | 3.7     |
| Goals Against | -37.8   |

Starter is a must. Clean sheets are huge besides that. Secondary considerations after these two are high save volume and low goals against. So look at xGOT and shots against.

## Defender
| Category      | Avg Pct |
| ------------- | ------- |
| Appearance    | 65.0    |
| Assist        | 4.1     |
| Clean Sheet   | 31.3    |
| Goal          | 6.5     |
| Goals Against | -47.6   |

Starter is a must again. Clean sheets and goals against are the basics. The very best also has some additional income from goals and assists but not an absolute must.

## Midfielder
| Category    | Avg Pct |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Appearance  | 49.5    |
| Assist      | 12.2    |
| Clean Sheet | 6.9     |
| Goal        | 18.3    |

Starts are still important but goal involvements are much more of a distinguishing factor. Top players also start picking up consistent BPS points.

## Striker
| Category   | Avg Pct |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Appearance | 38.4    |
| Assist     | 9.5     |
| Goal       | 33.5    |

All about goals for this position. Assists helpful but not essential. BPS points another stable source of income

# What is the level of BPS concentration for each team?
